== Demonstrate Exploring OpenShift Resources Lab

.Scenario

In the scenario for this demonstration lab, a developer wants to deploy the
 `cakephp-mysql-example` application from a Git repository and review the different
 OpenShift resources created for it.

:numbered:

== Demonstrate Authentication to OpenShift Master

. *Action*: Log in to the OPENTLC shared OpenShift web console using either
 of these methods:
* Method 1: Go to link:https://master.na39.openshift.opentlc.com[https://master.na39.openshift.opentlc.com^]
* Method 2: Use the command line from any host with the OpenShift client
 utility (`oc`) installed:
+
[source,bash]
----
LocalMachine$ oc login https://master.na39.openshift.opentlc.com --username username-domain.com
Username: username-domain.com
Password: **********
Logged into "https://master.na39.openshift.opentlc.com" as "username-domain.com" using existing credentials.
----


== Demonstrate Creating a Project

. *Action*: Click *Create Project* to create a project for your demonstration.
+
////

////
- *Explain* what projects are and how different projects can have different user
 permissions and quotas attached to them.

. *Action*: Fill in the *Name*, *Display Name*, and *Description* fields as follows:
* *Name*: `GUID-exploring-openshift`
+
[IMPORTANT]
Make sure you replace `GUID` with a unique identifier, such as your client's name or the four-character identifier you've received from OPENTLC (we use `tok` in the example below). Project names must be unique in OpenShift.
* *Display Name*: `Exploring OpenShift UI`
* *Description*: `This is the project for exploring OpenShift UI`
+
////
image::images/Explore_Demo02_Create_Project_Details.png[]
////
+
[TIP]
====
Two other options for completing this task:

* Use the command line from any host with the OpenShift client utility (`oc`) installed. Don't forget to replace `tok` in the example below with the actual GUID you've received from OPENTLC:
+
[source,bash]
----
[username-domain.com@bastion ~]$ export GUID=tok
[username-domain.com@bastion ~]$ oc new-project ${GUID}-exploring-openshift --description="This is the Project for exploring OpenShift UI" --display-name="Exploring OpenShift UI"
Now using project "tok-exploring-openshift" on server "https://master.na39.openshift.opentlc.com".
----
* Run the `oc new-project ${GUID}-exploring-openshift` command without the description
 and display name information.
